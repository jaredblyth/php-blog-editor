<p>What makes a <strong>Mother</strong>? To me, a mother shows unconditional love and kindness. A willingness to accept her children for who they are, not what they could become. A mother should also demonstrate a certain degree of wisdom, a mentoring capacity and an ability to teach right from wrong.</p>

<p>This <strong>Sunday 12 May</strong>, it is <strong>Mother&#39;s Day </strong>in Australia and New Zealand and an opportunity to say thank you to Mum - either through a kind word, a gift or a special outing.&nbsp; Some of the best gifts are those made by hand and with love.</p>

<p>Make sure you try the <strong>gluten free Lemon Polenta Cake recipe</strong>, adapted from Nigella&#39;s version this Mother&#39;s Day!</p>
