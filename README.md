Blog Editor is an easy to use content management system (CMS) designed and built in PHP & MySQL.

Set up instructions can be found in blogeditor/setup/README.txt. (see README.txt in https://github.com/jaredblyth/php-blog-editor/blob/master/blogeditor/setup/)

Screenshots and further information can be found at http://jaredblyth.com/page.php?id=64

Users write their blog entries into a template that then stores them in a MySQL database.

The blog entries can then be displayed in order on a news-feed styled webpage. 

These entries can also (optionally) be displayed on a public website. Blog Editor works in conjunction with my PHP Template - https://github.com/jaredblyth/php-template - just connect to the same MySQL database.

Users can edit their entries and also delete them.

Blog Editor has a cookie-based security system that requires the user to login with a password before making any changes.

Users can use the ckEditor to write rich text without needing to know HTML or CSS. Malicious code is automatically stripped to prevent "SQL injections".

Users can upload photos and add them to their blog entries.

Users can quickly scroll through their uploaded photos using fancybox.

Users can select multiple blog entries to bundle together as a newsletter.

I have also built an optional extension to Blog Editor that allows visitors to leave comments on a specific blog post.

I have also built a version of Blog Editor for .NET using visual basic and storing the data in a SQLServer database. https://github.com/jaredblyth/asp-net-blog-editor

I have also adapted Blog Editor into a system for managing a frequently asked questions (FAQs) section of a website for a large commercial client - See http://jaredblyth.com/page.php?id=70
